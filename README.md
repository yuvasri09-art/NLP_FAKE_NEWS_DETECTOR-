# Fake News Detection with NLP: Theoretical Overview

## 📝 Project Description
This project aims to detect fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system analyzes textual content to classify news as "real" or "fake" based on linguistic patterns, contextual cues, and semantic consistency. The workflow combines data preprocessing, machine learning (LSTM), and a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.

## 🔄 Workflow Overview
The project follows these stages:

### 1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - **Data Sources**: 
     - Real news from verified sources (e.g., Reuters).
     - Fake news from unreliable platforms (e.g., Kaggle’s `Fake.csv`).
   - **Preprocessing**:
     - **Cleaning**: Remove punctuation, lowercase text (except preserved terms like "CERN").
     - **Tokenization**: Split text into words/phrases.
     - **Lemmatization**: Reduce words to root forms (e.g., "running" → "run").
     - **Stopword Removal**: Filter generic words (e.g., "the," "and") but retain scientific terms.

### 2. **Feature Engineering**
   - **Tokenization & Padding**:
     - Convert text to numerical sequences.
     - Pad sequences to a fixed length (e.g., 300 tokens) for model input.
   - **Class Balancing**: Equalize real/fake samples to avoid bias.

### 3. **Model Architecture (LSTM)**
   - **Bidirectional LSTM**: 
     - Processes text sequences forward and backward to capture context.
     - Layers: Embedding → Bidirectional LSTM → Dropout → Dense.
   - **Training**:
     - Optimizer: Adam with learning rate scheduling.
     - Loss: Binary cross-entropy.
     - Class weights to prioritize "REAL" news detection.

### 4. **Heuristic Overrides**
   - **Preserved Terms**: Articles containing keywords like "NASA" or "CERN" are flagged as "REAL" by default to prioritize scientific credibility.
   - **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust prediction confidence thresholds (e.g., ≥0.6 for "REAL").

### 5. **Deployment**
   - **Gradio UI**: 
     - Users input news text.
     - The system displays predictions with confidence scores.
   - **Google Colab + ngrok**: 
     - Host the UI temporarily for demos.

## 🧩 Key Components
1. **Data Pipeline**  
   - Raw data → Cleaning → Balanced dataset (`cleaned_news.csv`).

2. **Model Pipeline**  
   - Tokenization → Sequence padding → LSTM training → Model saving.

3. **Prediction Pipeline**  
   - User input → Text cleaning → Tokenization → Model inference → Result.

## 🔧 Phases of Implementation
1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Curate datasets → Clean text → Balance classes.

2. **Model Development**  
   - Design LSTM layers → Train on sequences → Validate performance.

3. **Interface Design**  
   - Build UI → Integrate model → Deploy for testing.

4. **Validation**  
   - Test edge cases (e.g., scientific articles, clickbait headlines).

## 🎯 Why This Approach?
- **LSTM**: Handles sequential data (text) better than traditional models.
- **Heuristics**: Overrides model uncertainty for critical terms.
- **Streamlit**: Simplifies UI development for non-technical users.

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- Integrate BERT for contextual embeddings.
- Expand preserved terms (e.g., "WHO," "UNICEF").
- Deploy on cloud platforms (AWS/Azure) for scalability.
